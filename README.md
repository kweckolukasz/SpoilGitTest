It did many problems for all members of Java Course that I was participated that's why I came to the idea that if you have to work with it you have to know it well.
I Cover up most used commands for undoing things — revert, checkout, reset and managing work — branches, rabasing.
In a matter of fact, many of those items didn't work as expected for me, there are still a lot to cover.
